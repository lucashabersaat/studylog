## microservices

Microservices are a architectural style that by splitting up a complex application into isolated processes abstract the program on a much higher level.

Example, you have several backends, each serving a specific process. Those processes talk to each other and like this, for example, resource monitoring/load-balancing can be done much more elaborately.
