## log

### 29.09.2020

See if I keep this log. It seems taking notes while/after the lecture the way I want, is not realistic. The tempo is to fast, atleast for the last lecture. Going to just mark needed space, maybe do notes for some lecture, but generally postpone this to the learning phase.

I really look forward to the mini-project. I have a nice idea in mind and hope that my sturdy group members Tamara aka DÃ¤msel and Tatiana aka TatiSchnati will accept my humble epic suggestion of doing Rigid Body of a Solar System with Fracture. Meaning, we gonna blow up some planets. However, the project is not yet of my concern.

I am very ambitious and I don't want the graphics drama to repeat, where I wanted too much and was very disappointed of my failure and incompetence. See, my grade was still good, I just expected much more from me. So, first, I have a team of three, second, I intend to do a project where not the most difficult methods are involved. Meaning, some rather easy one, and then if it's going good, I extend it. So the planet system is a rigid body system with gravitation. That should be doable. I can try to make some nice renderings or similar to make it look good. Then, the fracture is a great plus.

To further improve the process I started this log. Just to think and analyse problems.

I want to do more in this course, but experience says that I will need maximum time to do the minimum, next to all my other projects. I probably need to focus more on one and finish that... For now, doing the exercises and thoroughly understanding them will do the job. An additional thing is looking for resources and linking them here.
