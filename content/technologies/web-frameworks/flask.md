# flask

## first insight

[Official Website ](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#the-request-object)provides a good documentation and quick start.

Flask is light, flexible and modular. It's a lot slimmer than Django which comes with a LOT of packages installed. So with Flask and its extensibles, you only have what you need.
