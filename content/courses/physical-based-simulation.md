## verdict

* very very interesting topics
* should have studies the lecture more during  semester/while doing the project
* don't visit lecture,  if you don't really listen, wasted that time

## log

### 29.09.2020

See if I keep this log. It seems taking notes while/after the lecture the way I want, is not realistic. The tempo is to fast, atleast for the last lecture. Going to just mark needed space, maybe do notes for some lecture, but generally postpone this to the learning phase.

I really look forward to the mini-project. I have a nice idea in mind and hope that my sturdy group members Tamara aka DÃ¤msel and Tatiana aka TatiSchnati will accept my humble epic suggestion of doing Rigid Body of a Solar System with Fracture. Meaning, we gonna blow up some planets. However, the project is not yet of my concern.

I am very ambitious and I don't want the graphics drama to repeat, where I wanted too much and was very disappointed of my failure and incompetence. See, my grade was still good, I just expected much more from me. So, first, I have a team of three, second, I intend to do a project where not the most difficult methods are involved. Meaning, some rather easy one, and then if it's going good, I extend it. So the planet system is a rigid body system with gravitation. That should be doable. I can try to make some nice renderings or similar to make it look good. Then, the fracture is a great plus.

To further improve the process I started this log. Just to think and analyse problems.

I want to do more in this course, but experience says that I will need maximum time to do the minimum, next to all my other projects. I probably need to focus more on one and finish that... For now, doing the exercises and thoroughly understanding them will do the job. An additional thing is looking for resources and linking them here.

### 1.12.2020

Starting to think about how to properly study this stuff. It's not that much. The course is only 5 credits. Yet, the matter is not easy at all. There are some concepts and math parts that really are hard to intuitively understand. I also think that some of the slides are not sooo good, because they skip some basic explanations, or just do not have enough information on it. I will definitely work with the recorded lectures. But, this will probably take too much time. I need to make an estimation of time effort for watching all of them again and taking notes.

There are 11 lectures, lasting 90 minutes atmost. For taking notes, I think I need to double that, just to be sure. Resulting in 33 hours or 4 days working 8h. Does not even sound so bad. Realistically it needs even more days, as I will not work 8h per day. But one week for note taking. One week buffer, code and exercises. Sounds good. I can do that.

I think I will already start in December, just because I have time then. Trying out to really study in advance and before the actual exam, just repeating some of the stuff. Or no. I split the weeks and I will do the second week just before the exam. Like this, I can really take advantage of my notes. I should be able to remeMber. Maybe add some smaller repetitions in between? Yes, that's the plan. Let's summarize.

1. Watch lectures and make notes during one week at beginning of learning phase
2. Repeat regularly
3. Repeat, do exercises, look at code during roughly one week before the actual exam.

### 20.1.2021

So, I am through with the **notes**, only need to fill gaps in them. Which will be the next step. After this, I will do an **Overview-Sheet**, a big picture of all chapters/keywords of the subject in a mind-map manner. Then, I will look at the example exam questions to get a sense for what is asked in the exam. Then, **identify** the hard parts and parts I need to really know and just **repeat** repeat and fill gaps and go where it hurts. Also at one point, look at the **exercises** and don't forget the **forum**.

**Wed 27.1**
