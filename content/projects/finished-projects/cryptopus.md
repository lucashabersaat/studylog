## Overview

During my internship at Puzzle ITC, I worked on the Open-Source Password Manager Cryptopus. Developed solely by the Puzzle BBT. We basically transformed it into a Single-Page-Application. Together with Nils Rauch, Luca Br√ºgger and Sylvain Gilgen, I worked from April to August in 2020 under supervision of Pascal Simon.
