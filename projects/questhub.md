A little idea of a 'perfect' todo application, or atleast one perfect for me.

## techstack

Not sure, what to use. Started with rails, but trying out a different web-stack is very tempting. Will look into django (python <3) and if it's not crap, will learn yet another framework.

Additionally, this project shall be professionally deployed on my personal server and there managed using openshift.

## todos
- [ ] setup locally
- [ ] get through tutorials
